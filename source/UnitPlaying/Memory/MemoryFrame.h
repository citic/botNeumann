/** A memory frame is graphical object to represent a piece of computer memory sliced into
	one or more memory rows, covered by a roof row. A label can be placed on the roof.

	The maximum size allowed to grow. There are two types of frames. Fixed-size frames have a
	fixed @a rowCount, usually 1 or higher. For example: memory segments. Dynamic-sized frames
	can grow when local variables are declared. These have @a maxSize value higher than 0. For
	example, function calls. The behavior between these two variables is shown in this table:

	   rowCount    maxSize   Behavior
			  0          0   Empty frame. Eg: a library function call
			 1+          0   Fixed-size frame. Eg: data segment
			  0        2^p   Dynamic-sized frame. Eg: function call
			 1+        2^p   Dynamic-sized frame with a known initial size
