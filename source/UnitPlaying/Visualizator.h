/**
	@brief Controller class in charge of controlling the visualization process.

	The visualizator mediates between the model (DebuggerCall) and the views (UnitPlayingScene and
	its helping classes).

	A visualizator object animates the execution of the player solution running against just one
	test case at time. If other test case should be animated, a new Visualization object must be
	created. Because an Unit can have several test cases, a different visualization may be
	produced from each single test case. UnitPlayingScene shows test cases and user may choose
	to visualize another. By default, the first test case of the unit is visualized each time
	the visualization starts.
