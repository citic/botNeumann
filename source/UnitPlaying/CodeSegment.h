	@brief Represents the data segment for the current unit.

	In order to solve the unit's problem, the current player may create several source files
	(e.g: main.cpp, MyClass.h, MyClass.cpp). These files are stored in a subfolder for the player

	The data segment (this class) lists all the source files that compound the current's player
	solution, and let him/her to switch between them. The CodeEditor object is able to show and
	edit only one of these files at time. Therefore, this class deals with some source files at
	time, whereas CodeEditor must be notified when the current file has changed.
