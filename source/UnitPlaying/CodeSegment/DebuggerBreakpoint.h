/** Manages breakpoints set in debugger

	There are two types of breakpoints in botNeumann. (1) GuiBreakpoints are set by user in line
	numbers area of code editors. (2) Breakpoints in debugger call. Usually they are synchronized
	because when visualization starts, GuiBreakpoints are sent to debugger. After visualization
	has started, user may remove or created new GuiBreakpoints. These are sent againg to the
	running debugger session and they are considered "valid" because source code is synchronized.
	But user may introduce line changes, such as insert lines or move code in editor. The source
	code in editor gets out-synchronized with source code in debugger. Any new breakpoint
	modification gets tricky, because line numbers is the method to "identify" breakpoints.

	Breakpoints are used in botNeumann to control the visualization. When users ask to run their
	solutions, there will happen two scenearios:

	-	If users have not set any explicit breakpoints, botNeumann stops at main() function.
		Therefore an implicit/hidden breakpoint is set. The visualization starts advancing one
		instruction at time at the speed set by the speed control.

	-	If users have defined explicit breakpoints, several instances of this structure are created
		and passed to the debugger (e.g: gbd). botNeumann also adds the implicit breakpoint at
		main() function. When visualization starts, it do not stops at main. It continues at
		maximum speed allowed by the computer (issuing gdb next instructions), in the same fashion
		the speed gauge is at top. Visualization will stop at the first user-defined breakpoint
		reached.

	User defined breakpoints are part of the player solution space. If user solution has several
	files, breakpoints may belong to different source files. The PlayerSolution class is able to
	store breakpoints in the user configuration files, in order to recover them when user continues
	a previous session.

	A GDB breakpoint has the following fields (values are examples):
	- number="1"
	- type="breakpoint"
	- disp="keep"
	- enabled="y"
	- addr="0x00001000e00"
	- func="main"
	- file="rand.c"
	- fullname="/tmp/app/rand.c"
	- line="7"
	- thread-groups=["i1"]
	- times="0"
	- original-location="main"

	Extra:
	- at="main+4"
