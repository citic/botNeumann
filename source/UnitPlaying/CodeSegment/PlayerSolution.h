@brief Manages the list of source files that compound the player's solution for an unit

	This class that manages the list of source files that the player creates to solve the problem
	stated by a specific unit. This class create the solution directory, create source files on it,
	retrieve the list of files if they exists, compiles the solution and interprets it.

	A player solution contains several types of files. Source code files are separated in two groups
	- Source files created by player: They can be edited by user in CodeEditor
	- Source files injected by botNeumann. These files contain code that support the visualization
	  process. For example, to know the number of bytes read from standard input
