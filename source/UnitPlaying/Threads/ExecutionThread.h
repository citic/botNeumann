/** An ExecutionThread is a graphical object to represent an execution thread running on the
	user program (inferior). An ExecutionThread that is running is shown in one of the available
	CpuCores. A sleeping ExecutionThread is not shown in any CpuCore.

	Execution threads are represented with two parts. 1: A robot shows the line number of the source
	code that the execution thread is running. 2: One or more stack frames represent the function
	calls that the execution thread is running. The top-most frame is the running function call.
